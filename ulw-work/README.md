# ulw-work

This folder contains a research report and a set of detailed plan prompts for building a VAE-style, cycle-consistent optimization on top of the existing L2T/T2L modes in this repo.

Contents:
- `ulw-work/research/vae_cycle_report.md`: research report (theory + mapping to this codebase + ablation + risks)
- `ulw-work/plans/`: a sequence of prompt-style markdown plans for future implementation work

Notes:
- ASCII-only by design.
- This work does not implement the training changes yet; it produces a precise design + execution prompts.
